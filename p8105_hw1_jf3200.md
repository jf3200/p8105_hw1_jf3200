## Problem 1

Here, we construct a data frame including one variable of each type:
numeric, logical, character and factor

``` r
# Create the data frame as per instructions

prob1_df = 
  tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_fact = factor(c("one", "two", "three", "one", "two", "one", "three", "three", "two", "one"))
  )
```

We will try to take the means of each of the variables in our data
frame.We can see that the means cannot be computed for character or
factor variables as we get a warning below and an output of NA

``` r
# Try to take the mean of each variable in the data frame
mean(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.3665391

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.2

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_fact))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, vec_fact)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Next, we will try to coerce the variables to numeric variables using the
`as.numeric` function. The output for this is not shown.

We observe that the logical vector is able to be converted to numeric.
The FALSE becomes 0 and the TRUE becomes 1 in order to compute the mean.

The character vector is converted to all NA, which explains why the mean
was NA when we took it previously.

The factor variable is converted to numbers 1,2 and 3. The numbers are
assigned based on alphabetical order of the factor variable. Previously,
we were unable to get a mean for the factor variable since it was not
numeric or logical, but when we convert it to numeric we will be able to
get a mean.

``` r
#Try to convert each variable to numeric 
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp_pos))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, vec_fact))
```

Below, we will try coercing the logical vector to numeric and
multiplying by the numeric random sample. Then, we will repeat the steps
by coercing it to a factor, and also to a factor and then to a numeric
in one step.

We get a warning and NAs when we try to multiple the logical variable
transformed into a factor variable by the numeric variable. We do not
get an error for the other conversions and we get an output of numbers

``` r
#convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result

as.numeric(pull(prob1_df,norm_samp_pos)) * pull(prob1_df, norm_samp)
```

    ##  [1] 0.9548789 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000
    ##  [8] 1.5867702 0.0000000 0.0000000

``` r
#convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random sample by the result

as.factor(pull(prob1_df,norm_samp_pos)) * pull(prob1_df, norm_samp)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp_pos)), pull(prob1_df, :
    ## '*' not meaningful for factors

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
#convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result

as.numeric(as.factor(pull(prob1_df,norm_samp_pos))) * pull(prob1_df, norm_samp)
```

## Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguins dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns. The variables
contained in the dataset are species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year. The
variables `sex`, `species` and `island` have class factor. The variables
`bill_length_mm` and `bill_dept_mm` have class numeric while the
variables `flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g` and `year` have class
integer.

The mean of flipper length is 200.9152047 excluding the NA entries.

We will show a scatterplot of `flipper_length_mm` vs.Â `bill_length_mm`
that is color coded by `species`

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

Looking at the plot, we see that the Gentoo species has the largest
flipper length on average. The flipper length of Adelie and Chinstrap
are similar in size. We also see that the Chinstrap and Gentoo species
have the largest bill lengths, followed by the Adelie. There appears to
be a slight positive correlation between bill length and flipper length
among all species.
